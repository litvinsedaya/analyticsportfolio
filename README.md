## 📊 Daria Litvin-Sedaya — Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

Hi, I’m Daria Litvin-Sedaya 🤝
For the last **8+ years** I’ve been working in analytics and data science across **EdTech, FinTech, Media, SaaS, Online Retail** — in CIS and globally.

### What I Do  

I design **analytics systems end-to-end** and make sure data connects directly to business outcomes.  
My work spans infrastructure cost optimization, product analytics, and multimedia/NLP projects.  

**Highlights:**  

- **Analytics Systems & Automation**  
  - Set up full analytics stacks from scratch — from event tracking and counter integration to ETL pipelines and BI dashboards.  
  - Migrated a complete event-based analytics stack to a free alternative, saving **$100k/year**.  
  - Built and automated reporting frameworks (cron jobs, Google Sheets integrations, Python scripts, Airflow DAGs, Zapier connectors).  

- **Product & Business Impact**  
  - Optimized infrastructure costs in a **Generative AI SaaS** by aligning unit economics with pricing and implementing predictive autoscaling (**–30% infra spend**).  
  - At a **Crypto FinTech startup**: designed and implemented the full analytics pipeline — from tracking setup to BI reporting. Insights from behavioral and funnel analysis increased conversion from **0.3% → 6% loyal users**.  

- **Media & NLP Projects (Independent TV Channel)**  
  - Developed an extension for a voice assistant (Python, Flask, NLP with NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, transformers).  
  - Implemented audio fingerprinting and frame-level video search to repackage TV content into podcasts, expanding multimedia presence and adding **+10% monetization**.  
  - Designed a custom profitability metric for paywalled programs and ran retention modeling for subscription audiences.

This repo contains a few public cases I can share. Each includes the problem, approach, and impact.

#### ⚡ Data is not just numbers — it’s business logic, user behavior, the ever-rising entropy of the universe, and infrastructure costs all brought together. My work is about making that connection easy, visible and actionable.
